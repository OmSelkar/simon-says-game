## **Idea**  
The **Simon Says Game** is a memory-based challenge where players must follow an increasing sequence of colored button flashes. The game tests a player's ability to remember and replicate the pattern, getting progressively harder as they advance through levels.  

The goal is to repeat the randomly generated sequence correctly for as long as possible, setting new high scores and improving memory skills.
